# Zero2Application

Welcome to Zero2Application, a project that showcases my dedication to building robust and feature-rich applications, even in challenging environments like Kivy Python.

## Overview

Zero2Application started as an ambitious endeavor to explore the capabilities of the Kivy framework for building cross-platform applications. While the initial concept may have taken a different direction, the journey itself was invaluable in honing my skills as a developer and pushing the boundaries of what I could achieve with technology.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implementing features like login via email OTP verification and Google login was a testament to my commitment to security and user privacy.
  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Leveraging Kivy Python, I successfully developed an application that could run seamlessly across different platforms, showcasing my adaptability and proficiency in diverse tech stacks.

## Project Evolution

While the original goal of Zero2Application may have evolved over time, the foundational work laid the groundwork for future projects. As I've grown both personally and professionally, I've redirected my focus towards more ethically sound endeavors, but I'm proud of the technical challenges I overcame during the development of this project.

## Note

It's essential to emphasize that Zero2Application has been archived and is no longer actively maintained. The decision to move on from this project was motivated by a desire to align my work with ethical standards and industry best practices.

## Getting Started

The magic of Zero2Application is that it still works! You can set up this project with very simple steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the necessary packages to run the application.

3. **Run the Application**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing the main Python file:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

    The application should launch successfully, allowing you to explore its features and functionalities.
